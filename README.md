Sup👋

At the moment I am a newbie in programming, learning C#. Currently I’m working on a telegram bot and an mvc project. I plan to become a good backend specialist, maybe even organize a team. 

I work until I realize my full potential, I’m ready to bring something new into this world, and I love positive vibes.

You can contact me via tg: [keefire](https://t.me/keefiremgmt) or you can check my own web-page 👉 [web-page](https://fokshakirill.github.io)
